Today **Firewalls** are more important than years before. Hackers and Bots are trying to invade your server. So what is the most effective way to prevent this?
Set up a firewall! But which one? **IPTables** is the strongest firewall in **Linux** environments. So we wanted to make IPTables usable by everyone. We created a simple **Web Interface** for IPTables so everyone can install and use it on his / her server.

## Features

- Configuration of Firewall Rules using a **simple Webinterface**
- **Blacklist** for blocking incoming triffic from a IPV4 / IPV6 Address
- **Whitelist** to allow all incoming network traffic from a specific IP Address
- Allow incoming traffic to a **single TCP or UDP Port**
- Allow incoming Traffic from a **TCP or UDP Port range**
- **Automatic Reset of Firewall Settings** on connection loss or bad firewall settings

## Demo

You can visit our Online Demo on the following URL:

The demo is resetting every 30 minutes and the data is erased. The demo only contains the web frontend, so the configuration made is not applied.

## Roadmap for the next release

Most of you noticed that there are a lot of changes made at the moment, but the release status is still in "development" and there are no minor releases. This is because I currently enhance the project until the next release. The reason for this is because I learned a lot of Python 3 coding the last year in my main job. I want to use this knowledge and clean this project up so everyone can use it and there are less bugs than before (there were a lot of bugs). If you want to support me and improve the development speed you can send me a beer on beerpay :beers:
