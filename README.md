Today **Firewalls** are more important than years before. Hackers and Bots are trying to invade your server. So what is the most effective way to prevent this?
Set up a firewall! But which one? **IPTables** is the strongest firewall in **Linux** environments. So we wanted to make IPTables usable by everyone. We created a simple **Web Interface** for IPTables so everyone can install and use it on his / her server.

## Features

- Configuration of Firewall Rules using a **simple Webinterface**
- **Blacklist** for blocking incoming triffic from a IPV4 / IPV6 Address
- **Whitelist** to allow all incoming network traffic from a specific IP Address
- Allow incoming traffic to a **single TCP or UDP Port**
- Allow incoming Traffic from a **TCP or UDP Port range**
- **Automatic Reset of Firewall Settings** on connection loss or bad firewall settings

## Demo

You can view an online version of the program as a demo under the following link:

<https://dev01vt.wdkro.de:12227/> (Certificate is provided by Let's Encrypt)

- **Username**: demo
- **Password**: demo

The online demo version is reset every 30 minutes and all data is deleted. The demo has only the frontend installed without the backend. Configuration changes are therefore not saved or applied.

## Support me

The project easywall was created in a time when I did not have any knowledge about Linux. Today I work as an administrator for Linux systems and would not need this project anymore. Nevertheless it is important to me to support the introduction to Linux and the use and simplification of firewalls. To continue the project, I need your support! Please donate some money so that I can continue the project in my spare time. Every dollar counts! You can find a donation link on [GitHub](https://github.com/jpylypiw/easywall).

## Roadmap for the next release

The following features will be implemented in one of the next versions. If you need a feature, simply create a GitHub issue, and we'll include it here.

- :x: create documentation in the Web interface for using `custom rules`
- :x: create a `pydoc` documentation
- :x: finish all `TODO: Docs` documentations
- :x: create a ansible role for easy installing
